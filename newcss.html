    <h1>GOOGLE</h1>
    <p>Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ (listen)) is an American <a href="/search">multinational</a> technology company that focuses on artificial intelligence,[10] search engine technology, online advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful company in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13][14] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.</p>

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[22][23][24] The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[25][26] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[27][28]

        While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[29] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[30][31] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[25]</p>

        <h3>GROWTH</h3>
        <p>In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[53] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[54] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[55][24] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[56] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[57][58]
